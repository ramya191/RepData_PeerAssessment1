## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


1. LOADING AND PROCESSING THE DATA

data <- read.table('activity.csv',sep = ",",header = TRUE, na.strings ="NA",
                   colClasses = c('integer','Date','factor'))
                   
2. REMOVING THE ROWS WITH NA
                   
new.data <- na.omit(data)

3. HISTOGRAM OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS TAKEN PER DAY

total.steps <- tapply(new.data$steps, new.data$date, FUN = sum)
plot1 <- ggplot(new.data, aes(date, steps)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity",binwidth = .5) +
        labs(title = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day",x = "Date", y = "Total Number of Steps")
print(plot1)

4. MEAN TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS PER DAY

mean(total.steps)

5. MEDIAN TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS PER DAY

median(total.steps)

6. AVERAGE DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERN

averages <- aggregate(new.data$steps, list(interval = as.numeric(as.character(new.data$interval))), FUN = "mean")
names(averages)[2] <- "Avg.Steps"

plot2 <- ggplot(averages, aes(interval, Avg.Steps)) + geom_line(color = "green", size = 0.7) + labs(title = "Time Series Plot of the 5-minute Intervals", x = "5-minute intervals", y = "Average Number of Steps Taken")
print(plot2)


7.Which 5-minute interval, on average across all days, contains the most steps?

averages[averages$Avg.Steps == max(averages$Avg.Steps),]

8. TOTAL NUMBER OF INCOMPLETE CASES

sum(!complete.cases(data))

9. Imputing missing values by using mean for that 5-minute interval

impData <- data 
for (i in 1:nrow(impData)) {
    if (is.na(impData$steps[i])) {
        impData$steps[i] <- averages[which(impData$interval[i] == averages$interval), ]$Avg.Steps
    }
}

sum(!complete.cases(impData))

10. HISTOGRAM OF TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS TAKEN EACH DAY

plot3 <- ggplot(impData, aes(date, steps)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity",binwidth = .5) +
        labs(title = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day (Imputed Data)",x = "Date", y = "Total Number of Steps")
print(plot3)

11. MEAN OF TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS

total.steps.impute <- tapply(impData$steps, impData$date, FUN = sum)
mean(total.steps.impute)

12. MEDIAN OF TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS

median(total.steps.impute)

13. CREATING FACTOR VARIABLES WHETHER THE DATE IS A WEEKDAY OR WEEKEND

impData$weekdays <- factor(format(impData$date, "%A"))
levels(impData$weekdays)

levels(impData$weekdays) <- list(weekday = c("Monday", "Tuesday",
                                             "Wednesday", 
                                             "Thursday", "Friday"),
                                 weekend = c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
levels(impData$weekdays)


table(impData$weekdays)

14. Graphing panel plot containing time series plot of each 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days, split into weekdays and weekends.

new.averages <- aggregate(impData$steps, 
                      list(interval = as.numeric(as.character(impData$interval)), 
                           weekdays = impData$weekdays),
                      FUN = "mean")
names(new.averages)[3] <- "meanOfSteps"
library(lattice)
plot4 <- xyplot(new.averages$meanOfSteps ~ new.averages$interval | new.averages$weekdays, 
       layout = c(1, 2), type = "l", 
       xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
print(plot4)
